# Mapping Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map displaying tectonic plates and earthquake data from the past 7 days. 
The map has 3 base layers which the viewer can choose from. The three base layers are:
1. Streets
2. Satellite
3. Dark

The map has 3 overlays so the viewer can choose which data they would like to focus on or view all of them at once. The three overlays are:
1. Earthquakes
2. Tectonic Plates
3. Major Earthquakes

The radius of each circle marker is relative to the magnitude of the earthquake. Additionally, the circle marker color helps the viewer understand the magnitude of the earthquake. The legend in the bottom right corner specifies the color that represents the earthquake magnitude range.

The "Major Earthquakes" overlay displays earthquakes with a magnitude less than 5, a magnitude greater than 5, and a magnitude greater than 6. This is overlay is a simplified version of the "Earthquakes" overlay.
