# Mapping Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map displaying tectonic plates and earthquake data from the past 7 days. The map has 3 overlays so the viewer can choose which data they would like to focus on. The three overlays are:
1. Tectonic Plates
2. Earthquakes
3. Major Earthquakes

The radius of each circle marker is relative to the magnitude of the earthquake. Additionally, the circle marker color  helps the viewer understand the magnitude of the earthquake.
To view earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4, select the "Major Earthquakes" overlay.
